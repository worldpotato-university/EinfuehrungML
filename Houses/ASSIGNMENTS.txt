Welcome to the tutorial Houses.

The price of houses in a specific region shall be investigated.
A huge amount of recent house prices was collected, including:
- the living area (Wohnfläche) and the plot area (Grundstücksfläche) [m²] (matrix X)
- the price [€] (vector y).

Assignments:
------------
1. How many house sales were recorded?
2. Understand the contents of the matrix X and the vector y.
   It is a good idea to print out the data of the first 10 entries.
3. Plot the data.
4. Perform a linear regression (no constant term, quadratic cost function).
5. Estimate the price of a house with 150 m² living area and 500 m² plot area.

Optional problem:
By typing  load('houses2')  you obtain a second data set (watch out, the first
data set is going to be erased!). This new data set contains an additional column
which specifies if the house is located at a preferred location (1) or an ordinary
one (0). Repeat the assignments 1-5 and find a way to use the new column.

The following file(s) were prepared for you in the current directory.
Use them to perform the assignments:
   assignmentHouses.m
   Houses2.mat
   Houses.mat

You can reload the prepared variables by typing  load('Houses.mat');

Have fun!

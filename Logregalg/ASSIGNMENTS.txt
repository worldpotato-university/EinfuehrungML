Welcome to the tutorial Logregalg.

We are going to perform a logistic regression analysis in this session.
In this directory, some functions have already been pre-defined for you.
Some of the functions, however, need to be completed.
The used data are artificial 2D data to make things simple.

Assignments:
------------
1. A script runLogReg2D.m ist prepared which creates some data for a
   logistic regression, calls the learning algorithm and displays the result.
   You can call it by typing
       runLogReg2D
   The call of the gradient descent algorithm is currently commented out.
   Run the script to get a feeling for the data.
2. Now, comment in the call of the gradient descent algorithm. The functions
   logRegHypo.m, crossEntropy.m and dCrossEntropyLogReg.m need to be adapted
   to make the algorithm work. Keep in mind that all sample vectors contain
   one sample per ROW. The parameter vector theta also stores all parameters
   in one ROW. The derivative is not given in the slides of the lecture,
   you have to calculate it on your own.
   The formula of the cross-entropy is
       C(h,y)    = -1/N \sum_{i=1}^N ( y_i \ln h_i + (1-y_i) \ln( 1 - h_i ) )
       h_i       = \sigma( w'*x_i )
       \sigma(x) = 1 / (1+\exp(-x))
   We need the derivative with respect to the w.
3. Check your solution with the slightly more difficult data set (3D data)
   defined by the script runTest3D. If an error occurs, you probably need to
   check the transpose signs in your equations.

The following file(s) were prepared for you in the current directory.
Use them to perform the assignments:
   logRegHypo.m
   crossEntropy.m
   dCrossEntropyLogReg.m
   runLogReg2D.m
   gradientDescent.m
   plotLogReg2D.m
   sigmoid.m
   runTest3D.m

Have fun!

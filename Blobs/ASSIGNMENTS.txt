Welcome to the tutorial Blobs.

5000 dust particles have been analyzed by an image processing system.
It considers the particles as simple spots (so-called "blobs").
The system measures the surface area, as well as the length of the
semimajor and semiminor axis of a fitted ellipse. The problem is to
group the particles into similar groups and to find their characteristics.

Assignments:
------------
1. In the file runblobs.m there are some MATLAB code lines prepared
   for you. Modifiy the file to plot the data (just change one line).
   The plotted data may look awkward.
2. The data have to be preprocessed by normalization. Add the code into
   the file and plot the normalized data.
   Tips: Use the Matlab functions mean and std (type "help mean" etc to
         get more information). You can do normalization without any
         for-loops. Use e. g. the function repmat(Xbar,N,1) to obtain
         a matrix which can be subtracted from X.
3. Now plot the normalized data and compare the result with the
   raw data. Add one line of code.
4. The kmeans algorithm was already coded for you in kmeans.m. Inspect the
   code and call it from your script. To see the result, do not forget to
   comment in the plot commands at the end of the script. You will need to
   define initial centroids. Do it using random numbers generated by the
   function randn.
5. Observe how the clustering changes as new initial centroid values,
   another number of requested cluster, or another distance function
   is used.

The following file(s) were prepared for you in the current directory.
Use them to perform the assignments:
   runblobs.m
   kmeans.m
   Blobs.mat

You can reload the prepared variables by typing  load('Blobs.mat');

Have fun!

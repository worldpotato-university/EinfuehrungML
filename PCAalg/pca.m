% Runs a principal component analysis on the data.
% inputs:
% Xc:  the CENTERED data matrix, one sample per row
% dim: (optional) the number of principal axes requested. By default,
%           all principal components are returned.
% outputs:
% V:    the matrix of principal axes, one axis per column
% mu:   the mean vector (the data are automatically centered)
% sig2: the singular values (the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix)

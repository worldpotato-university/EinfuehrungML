Welcome to the tutorial Logregmnist.

We are going to perform a logistic regression analysis in this session.
In this directory, all functions have already been pre-defined for you.

Assignments:
------------
1. There is already our MNIST data set (the handwritten digits) prepared
   for you. Run a logistic regression on them by typing
      runMNIST
   You will only see the progress of the regression and no images.
   Try to interpret the code. What exactly is classified?
2. If you are interested in the images, you can plot them by typing
      dispImage( imgs(45,:) );
   (or any other number between 1 and 60000).
   Investigate the data set.
3. Look at some images which are misclassified. Do you see any
   communalities between them?

The following file(s) were prepared for you in the current directory.
Use them to perform the assignments:
   logRegHypo.m
   crossEntropy.m
   dCrossEntropyLogReg.m
   gradientDescent.m
   plotLogReg2D.m
   sigmoid.m
   runMNIST.m

Have fun!

Welcome to the tutorial Energy.

The energy consumption of an electric car shall be investigated.
At a huge amount of test drives, the following data was collected:
- the energy consumption [MJ] (variable y)
- the duration of the drive [min] (variable X).

Assignments:
------------
1. How many test drives have been performed?
2. Plot the data.
3. Perform a linear regression (no constant term, quadratic cost function).
4. Estimate the energy consumption of a 20 min drive.
5. Add the regression line to the plot.
6. Compare the result with the regression line obtained by a MAP estimator.
   You will need a really big parameter lambda to see a difference.

The following file(s) were prepared for you in the current directory.
Use them to perform the assignments:
   assignmentEnergy.m
   Energy.mat

You can reload the prepared variables by typing  load('Energy.mat');

Have fun!
